This script is for generating two figures associated with the attendance
at various outreach activities throughout the year.  One is a histogram
of outreach events per year and their total attendance, the other is just
a scatter plot showing attendance at each event as a function of date.

The input for this script is a text file listing each event as a
separate line employing the following format:

# month day year attendees event_code
# where event_code is:
0 = lecture/stargazing
2 = astro on tap
3 = special event (eclipse, science fair)
4 = guerilla astronomy

Example:

03 24 2011   20 3
07 19 2013  100 0
10 17 2016  130 2

Run script as:

$ python outreach_attendance.py caltech.txt
